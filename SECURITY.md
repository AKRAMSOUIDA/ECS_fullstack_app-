## 🔒 Security Best Practices

This repository follows security best practices to protect sensitive information:

### ✅ **What's Protected**
- AWS Account IDs and ARNs are sanitized
- Private keys and certificates are excluded
- Task definitions with sensitive data are not committed
- Environment variables are properly managed
- Credentials are never stored in code

### 🛡️ **Security Measures Implemented**

#### **Code Security**
- No hardcoded credentials or secrets
- Environment variables for configuration
- Sanitized documentation and examples
- Comprehensive .gitignore for sensitive files

#### **Container Security**
- Non-root user containers
- Minimal base images (Alpine Linux)
- Security scanning enabled
- Resource limits configured

#### **Network Security**
- VPC isolation
- Security group restrictions
- SSL/HTTPS encryption
- Private subnet deployment (recommended)

#### **Access Control**
- IAM roles with least privilege
- Service-specific permissions
- No embedded access keys
- Temporary credentials preferred

### 🔧 **For Deployment**

When deploying this application:

1. **Replace Placeholders**: Update `<account-id>` and `<region>` with your values
2. **Environment Variables**: Set proper environment variables
3. **SSL Certificates**: Use valid certificates for production
4. **Network Configuration**: Configure VPC and subnets appropriately
5. **Monitoring**: Enable CloudWatch and alerting

### 📋 **Security Checklist**

- [ ] All sensitive data removed from code
- [ ] Environment variables configured
- [ ] SSL/HTTPS certificates valid
- [ ] Network security groups configured
- [ ] IAM roles follow least privilege
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting enabled
- [ ] Backup and disaster recovery planned
